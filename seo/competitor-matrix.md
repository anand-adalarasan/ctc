## The honest picture for "chicago tamil church"

Another congregation is literally named **Chicago Tamil Church** and owns the exact-match domains. Google reads "chicago tamil church" partly as a search for that church by name. That means:

- Ranking **#1 organically for that exact phrase every time is not something any SEO work can guarantee.** Google may keep showing the church with the matching name for navigational searches.
- What we *can* win: the **local pack (map results)** for "tamil church chicago" / "tamil church near me" from the western suburbs, **#1 for "tamil church chicago"** and every suburb variant, **#1 for "indian church" + DuPage towns**, and a strong second result plus the knowledge panel for the exact phrase.
- Never use "Chicago Tamil Church" as our name or try to confuse the two churches. It harms visitors and risks trademark and spam penalties. Use the phrase *Tamil church in Chicago* in natural language instead.

## Differentiation angles (use these in content)

1. **Morning service with English included.** Our 10:30 AM bilingual service fits families who don't want a 12:30 or 2:30 start, and it suits spouses and kids who prefer English.
2. **The best children's program among Tamil churches.** Kids Circle, B.L.A.S.T. Sunday School and VBS, with 40 kids' and VBS videos as proof.
3. **A church you can join every week, not just on Sunday.** Friday Bible study, Mon–Thu prayer and monthly fasting prayer.
4. **Raising the next generation in Tamil faith and culture.** This is stated in the mission, and no competitor says it this clearly.
5. **You can see us before you visit.** 160+ videos let a newcomer watch a real service first.
6. **DuPage location.** Closer than Westchester or Hickory Hills for Naperville, Lisle, Woodridge, Bolingbrook, Aurora and Wheaton.

## Technical issues (blockers ahead of any content)

| ID | Issue | Impact | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **T1** | Two live domains (`.com` old site, `.us` new site) | Ranking signals split; duplicate content; conflicting service times | **Decided: christtamilchurch.com.** When the new build moves there, update `public/CNAME`, keep the old-URL redirects in `App.tsx`, and 301 `.us` → `.com`. Until then, do not point canonical URLs at `.com` (it still serves the old site). |
| **T2** | Deep links served through the GitHub Pages `404.html` trick | Google receives **HTTP 404** for `/visit`, `/worship`, etc., so inner pages are probably not indexed | Prerender every route to `dist/<route>/index.html` at build time |
| **T3** | Client-only rendering + JS-injected titles | Crawlers and AI tools see one generic title and an empty body | Same fix as T2 (static HTML per route, with title, description and canonical baked in) |
| **T4** | No structured data | No rich results, weak entity signals for AI overviews | `Church` JSON-LD (NAP, geo, `openingHoursSpecification`/`Event` for services, `sameAs`), plus `FAQPage`, `Event`, `VideoObject` and `BreadcrumbList` |
| **T5** | No sitemap.xml or robots.txt | Slower discovery | Generate both at build time |
| **T6** | Inconsistent NAP across the web (time, phone) | Hurts local-pack ranking | Fix Google Business Profile, Facebook, Sulekha, psalmlog and Yelp to match `site.ts` exactly |
| **T7** | No Open Graph tags | Weak WhatsApp/Facebook sharing, which is how Tamil families spread the word | Per-route `og:` tags plus an image |

## Off-site levers (as important as the website for local queries)

- **Google Business Profile.** Claim or verify it. Primary category "Church", secondary "Christian church" and "Protestant church". Description should include "Tamil and English"; add Sunday hours, 20+ real photos, and weekly posts. **Ask members for Google reviews that mention "Tamil church"**, since review count and wording are the strongest local-pack factors.
- **Citations.** Add the church to thokalath.com, courtesyindia.com, garamchai.com, Sulekha, Apple Maps, Bing Places, churchfinder.com and Yelp, all with identical details.
- **Community links.** Chicago Tamil Sangam, Illinois Tamil associations, university Indian student associations (UIC, IIT, NIU, Northwestern), and nearby Indian grocery bulletin boards.
- **YouTube.** Put "Tamil Church Chicago" and the website URL in the channel description and every video description.
