# Keyword & Content Pillar Map

_Generated 2026-10-06. Facts must come from `feature-registry.json`; competitive angles come from `competitor-matrix.md`._

## Primary goal

Be the first result for **Tamil church Chicago**, **Chicago Tamil church**, **Indian church Illinois**, and *Tamil / Indian church + Chicago-suburb* searches. Win both the organic results and the Google map pack.

## Ground rules

- **R1. One primary keyword per URL.** Never let two pages target the same term.
- **R2. Facts from the registry only.** No invented ministries, times or statistics. Mark anything unverified and ask leadership.
- **R3. Answer first.** Every page opens with a 40–60 word direct answer (who, what, when, where) so AI overviews and featured snippets can quote it.
- **R4. No doorway pages.** Do not create 20 near-identical "Tamil church in [town]" pages. Build one strong area hub with genuinely useful drive-time and directions content per region, as shown below.
- **R5. Bilingual signals.** Use the Tamil terms naturally (தமிழ் சபை, தமிழ் கிறிஸ்தவ ஆலயம், ஆராதனை) in headings and body text. Tamil-script searches have almost no competition.
- **R6. Follow the design template.** New pages follow the inner-page blueprint in `docs/design-system/ctc-design-template.md`.

## Blog / Clay Pot spokes (optional, start after the technical fixes)

The old site had a "Clay Pot" blog. Revive it only if someone can publish 1–2 posts a month. Good topics that link back to hubs:

1. What to expect at a Tamil church service in Chicago (→ /visit)
2. Tamil churches in Chicagoland: how to choose one for your family (→ hub). Write it respectfully and do not criticise named churches.
3. Raising bilingual Tamil Christian kids in America (→ /grow/sunday-school)
4. Tamil Christmas carol rounds: a Chicago tradition (→ /events)
5. Moving to Chicago from Chennai, Bangalore, Singapore or Sri Lanka: a faith-family checklist (→ /new-to-chicago)

## Required on every page

- A unique `<title>`, meta description, canonical URL and `og:` tags, all in the static HTML.
- One H1 containing the primary keyword, then a logical H2/H3 hierarchy.
- An answer-first opening paragraph that states **Sunday 10:30 AM · 1330 63rd St, Downers Grove**.
- Alt text that describes the scene and includes the place, e.g. "Children singing at Christ Tamil Church VBS in Downers Grove". No keyword stuffing.
- An FAQ section of 3–6 questions with `FAQPage` JSON-LD. Seed questions:
  - Is the service in Tamil or English? → Both.
  - Do I need to speak Tamil to attend? → No.
  - Is there a program for my kids? → Kids Circle + B.L.A.S.T.
  - Where do I park? (leadership to confirm)
  - How far is it from Naperville / Chicago? → drive-time table
  - Can I watch online? → YouTube
- Internal links: every spoke links to its hub, and to **/visit** (the primary CTA) and **/worship**. The hub links to all spokes. Use descriptive anchor text such as "Tamil and English Sunday worship", never "click here".
- Site-wide `Church` JSON-LD in the layout.

## Measurement

- Google Search Console: verify the canonical domain and submit the sitemap. Track impressions and position for each P0/P1 query every month.
- Google Business Profile insights: calls, direction requests, searches for "tamil church".
- Goal for the first 90 days after the technical fixes: inner pages indexed, local pack for "tamil church near me" within DuPage, top 3 for "tamil church chicago".
